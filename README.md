### 🔍 Task Overview

In this machine learning task during my internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**, I built a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a customer will **purchase a product or service**, based on demographic and behavioral attributes. The model was trained using the **Bank Marketing dataset** from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**, which includes features like age, job, marital status, education, and past campaign outcomes.
